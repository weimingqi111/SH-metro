# SH-metro
The SH-metro dataset is carefully selected from video images captured at different time periods in different carriages of a metro line in Shanghai with a fixed camera viewpoint.It is mainly used for training and testing of metro passenger detection models.

The SH-metro dataset was developed to address the challenges of perspective deformation and occlusion within natural subway settings. We gathered video footage from different carriages at various times to account for the variance in internal structures and camera positions across these carriages. Specifically created for subway passenger detection, the dataset consists of 2,128 images with a resolution of 720Ã—1280. Each image has been meticulously manually annotated, with bounding boxes identifying the heads and bodies of passengers. The dataset is segmented into three subsets: 80% for training, 10% for validation, and 10% for testing purposes. By offering a more accurate depiction of subway scenarios, the SH-metro dataset aids in the evaluation and development of effective passenger detection techniques in subway environments.

Given that this dataset contains a substantial number of facial images of passengers from the Shanghai Metro, it directly involves issues related to personal privacy. To ensure compliance and controlled use of the data, we require researchers interested in utilizing this dataset to contact us and sign a confidentiality agreement.
